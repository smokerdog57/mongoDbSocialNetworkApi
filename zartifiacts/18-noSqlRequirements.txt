# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

### GitHub repository:  	https://github.com/smokerdog57/noSqlSocialNetworkApi
### Chrome Cast Recording:	https://xxx

## Operational Concept

 AS A social media startup, I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database,  SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured dataMongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, you’ll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.

Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. Use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

Create seed data using Insomnia after API is created..

Because this application won’t be deployed, create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following requirements being met.  Submit a link to the Chrome Cast recording.

*** Directory Structure

this directory structure needs to be modified for the Mongoose ODM.

## Description


## Installation
  
1. Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB 7.0 Community Edition on Windows locally.
2. create a new github repository named 'noSqlSocialNetworkApi'
3. launch microsoft visual studio
4. enter cli:  cd ~/bootcamp/homework
5. enter cli:  git clone <repository> // creates noSqlSocialNetworkAp folder (project root directory)
6. enter cli:  cd noSqlSocialNetworkAp
7. enter cli:  npm init // this initializes the package.json project file
8. Edit the `package.json` file to add the following dependencies:
   - "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
   - "express": "^4.18.2",
   - "mongoose": "^7.0.2"
   - and dev dependency:  "nodemon": "^2.0.9"
9. enter cli: npm install //install the dependencies
10. After running above steps create, copy and/or confirm the following directory structure and files:
	assets			// copy from challenge
	config
	controllers
	models
	utils
	index.js
	.env
	.gitignore
	node_modules		// confirm: created by npm	
	package.json		// confirm: created by npm		
	package-lock.json		// confirm: created by npm	
	README.md		// copy from challenge

## Usage

1. open MS Visual Studio and terminal
2. enter cli:  cd noSqlSocialNetworkApi
3. enter cli:  npm start
4. Launch insomnia and send api requests to test the app

## Requirements
```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend listb

Create the following models:
### Models

**User**:

* `username`
  * String
  * Unique
  * Required
  * Trimmed

* `email`
  * String
  * Required
  * Unique
  * Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

* `thoughts`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

* `friends`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

* `thoughtText`
  * String
  * Required
  * Must be between 1 and 280 characters

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

* `username` (The user that created this thought)
  * String
  * Required

* `reactions` (These are like replies)
  * Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

* `reactionId`
  * Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  * Default value is set to a new ObjectId

* `reactionBody`
  * String
  * Required
  * 280 character maximum

* `username`
  * String
  * Required

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.

### API Routes

**`/api/users`**

* `GET` all users

* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

* `POST` a new user:

```json
// example data
{
  "username": "lernantino",
  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

**BONUS**: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

* `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

* `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**

* `GET` to get all thoughts

* `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

* `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

```json
// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "lernantino",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---

**`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`**

* `POST` to create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field

* `DELETE` to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's `reactionId` value

```
